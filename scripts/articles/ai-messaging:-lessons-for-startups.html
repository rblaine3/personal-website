                <p>Arthur Clarke’s quote, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," is particularly relevant when discussing artificial intelligence (AI). Today, when we hear “AI,” most of us think of Generative AI and the advancements from companies like OpenAI and Google. However, by focusing solely on Large Language Model (LLM) providers, we overlook the many emerging product companies that are leveraging AI within their applications to provide enhanced experiences. Startups building with AI should be cautious about imitating the go-to-market strategies of leaders like OpenAI (or any LLM provider). Instead, they should adopt best practices for marketing and messaging, while balancing AI-specific considerations. Below are 4 key practices for messaging an AI startup:</p><p><strong>Understand Your Audience, Message the Benefits</strong></p><p>OpenAI and Google are providing foundational models and messaging to a much broader audience than most SaaS businesses. These companies focus on wowing potential users with demos that highlight how revolutionary their technology is. Their aim is to showcase the cutting-edge nature of their AI, often targeting a tech-savvy and diverse global audience.</p><p>For most businesses, however, the technology itself is not what users are buying; it's the experience obtained from using that technology. Users are interested in how AI can solve their specific problems, enhance their workflows, and deliver tangible benefits. Therefore, it's crucial for emerging AI product companies to shift the focus from the technical to the practical advantages AI offers. Understanding your audience is the first step in crafting effective messaging. Different user segments have different needs, pain points, and levels of understanding about AI. Tailoring your message to address these specific aspects is key to resonating with your target audience.</p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>Use Visuals and Demonstrations</strong></p><p>People grasp concepts better when they see them in action, and this is especially true for AI. Instead of focusing solely on the AI itself, it's essential to highlight the overall experience it creates. AI can be abstract, so showcasing its real-world applications helps make it more tangible for potential buyers. Visuals can effectively demonstrate how AI integrates into workflows, making complex processes easier to understand. By illustrating practical benefits and seamless integration, visuals can bridge the gap between abstract technology and its real-world uses.</p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>Be Careful How You Walk the Line of Human-AI Interactions</strong></p><p>A recent example of the pitfalls in AI marketing is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck">Google’s Olympics ad</a>, which faced backlash for using AI to draft a personal letter from a young fan to an athlete. Critics argued that this automation removed the heartfelt nature of the moment. Messaging around AI needs to balance task automation with preserving the human essence - personal interactions and relationships.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="751" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F637ebf79-957a-44ec-b5ba-b2335eab9683_1461x754.png" width="1456"/><figcaption class="image-caption">The Google Gemini ad had a father using Gemini to draft a letter for his daughter to send to her favorite Olympic athlete</figcaption></figure></div><p>AI can help with idea generation, simplifying concepts, and copywriting. These use cases supplement similar activities and are generally well-accepted. However, relying solely on AI for relationship-building tasks can lead to negative reactions like the response to the Google Olympics ad. It’s crucial to maintain focus on the role of the human user and their experiences to avoid showcasing an example like this of using AI to falsify a genuine connection. By ensuring that messaging should show how AI augments rather than replaces human touchpoints, companies can leverage technology to enhance, rather than detract from, the authenticity of their interactions.</p><div><hr/></div><p><strong>Sell the Longer-Term Vision</strong></p><p>Potential customers need a clear understanding of your product’s future direction, which means highlighting the broader vision beyond its current features. Clearly presenting your product’s long-term vision in the context of the evolving AI landscape will help customers see the benefits of a sustained, long-term partnership with your company. It’s crucial to explain how your product aims to address current customer challenges and the potential benefits it will offer as it evolves, particularly as AI underlying certain features advances. We are at a pivotal moment where companies can build products that show significant improvements in line with the advances of models integrated into their workflows. Discussing how you see your product developing will boost your customers’ confidence, position your company as a market leader, and demonstrate your commitment to continuous innovation and value creation.</p>
